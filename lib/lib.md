# Lib
## The lib layer is where we group the modules/domains. (Event, People, Places)

What should we add to this library? Anything about the domain that isn't a component, like:

- bussiness logic
- queries
- mutations
- custom hooks
- contexts
- props functions (getServerSideProps, getInitialProps)
